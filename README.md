# WeatherDashboardWeatherDashboard

This weather dashboard application connects to the OpenWeather API to and pulls in 3 sets of data to display weather: current weather conditions for any given city, the 5 day weather forecast for any given city, as well as the Longitude and Latitude objects returned from the initial API call to display the UV index for that given city.
